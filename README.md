# hello-world
The beginning of my programming into C#
I know a miniscule amount of coding and want to make my computer vocabulary bigger in order to enrich the quality my life and others... I guess. Also so I can brag that I know C#, which honestly kinda blows my mind that its called "C-SHARP". I feel like I'm at band camp. Not that it is a bad name, just kinda interesting. Also, I like big butts, so you know I must not be able to lie...unless I lied about liking big butts.
